The C++ STL allocator model has various flaws. For example, they are fixed to a certain type, because they are almost required to be templates, you can't easily share a single allocator for multiple types. In addition, you can only get a copy from the containers and not the original allocator object. At least with C++11 they are allowed to be stateful, so it can be made object not instance based. But still, the model has many flaws. Over the course of the years many solutions have been proposed. for example EASTL. This library is another. But instead of trying to change the STL, it works with the current implementation.
